#SLIME DUM 

Slime dum was created on an university project made by my team, it is a 2D game of a slime who has to go through 2 levels in order to accomplish his goal.

It doesn't have much lore or history, it is more based on the creation and testing of the videogame functions and code made in Unity and C#.

ADVISOR:
After testing this game lately before uploading it here I realize at the moment to run the game there are some minors errors that can be fixed.
- Music from main menu and levels mixed.
- The level "THE ZONE" has a minor bug where the character doesn't appears.

This minors mistakes can be solved and if I do I will upload a new commit with everything working at it's 100%.
